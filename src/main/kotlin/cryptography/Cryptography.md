# Omneo Cryptography
___
## The 3 Goals
1. Prioritize **security over speed**
2. Being **Modular**
3. **KISS** to maintain

## How to Navigate
- **cryptography**
  - **cipher:** contains every algorithm for cryptography needs
  - **core:** contains interfaces and shared components in **cryptography**
  - **exceptions:** contains every cryptographic exceptions
  - **factory:** contains factory in order to make cryptographic objects
  - **keys:** contains every kind of key

## Classifications of the different algorithms
- **legacy:** for algorithms which will be vulnerable to quantum computers
- **modern:** for algorithms that are quantum resistant if we simply increase the size of the key(s)
- **post-quantum:** for algorithms that are quantum resistant
